1) Assemble the unit:

A. The Sensor Shield attaches on top of the Arduino Uno

B. The SD Card is placed in the SD Card Slot of the sensor shield

C. The Short USB Power cable is plugged into the battery, then plugged into the Arduino Uno

D. The unit takes approximately 10 seconds to boot up, initialize the SD card and begin taking readings!


2) Let the Unit Run for 3 minutes 

The default sample rate is 1 reading per minute.

3) Unplug the Power and Read the SD card with a computer.

Remove the SD Card, and plug into any laptop or computer with an SD Card Reader.

On the disk, you will see a file called 'DATA.CSV', example contents:

Time,Temperature (F),Humidity,Pressure (in Hg),Light (Raw value 0-1023),Light (qualitative descriptor)

   CONFIG/TIME.TXT -- Set Time Sleep Interval in minutes
   CONFIG/ALT.TXT -- Set Altitude Units and Activate
   CONFIG/RTCSET.TXT -- Set To the current calendar information to adjust system time.
   CONFIG/_RTCSET.TXT -- Example RTC File to make clock setting easy.
